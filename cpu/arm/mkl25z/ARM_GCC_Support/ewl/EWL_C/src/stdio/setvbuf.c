 *
 *	Implementation Notes
 *	--------------------
 *
 *		Technically, there is no such thing as "unbuffered I/O" (_IONBF) in this
 *		implementation. With two exceptions (noted below) all I/O passes through a
 *		buffer.
 *
 *		_IONBF forces the use of a single-character internal buffer that is
 *		associated with each file (whether used or not). Both _IOLBF and _IOFBF
 *		indicate the use of either a user-supplied or an internally-allocated
 *		buffer. A newly opened file effectively has already had a
 *
 *		   setvbuf(f, NULL, _IOFBF, BUFSIZ)
 *
 *		done for it. Any subsequent setbuf or setvbuf disposes of this buffer.
 *		Console input via SIOUX is line buffered automatically; there is no way to
 *		force it to do anything else.
 *
 *		fread() and fwrite() will bypass buffers for binary I/O once the buffers
 *		are empty. Thus, if you are *only* doing fread() and/or fwrite() on a file
 *		in binary mode, then perhaps it makes sense to use _IONBF on a file;
 *		otherwise, using _IONBF will result in rather poor performance.
 *
 *		While reading from/writing to a buffer, buffer_ptr points to the next byte
 *		to be read from/written to. buffer_pos indicated the file_position of the
 *		first byte in the buffer. Thus, the current file position can be inferred
 *		from buffer_pos and buffer_ptr (as well as the base address of the
 *		buffer). buffer_ptr is also used, when writing, to infer the number of
 *		bytes written. buffer_size is the number of bytes available in the buffer.
 *		buffer_len indicates the number of bytes left in the buffer to read or the
 *		number of bytes left in the buffer to be written to.
 *
 *		The getc/putc macros depend on buffer_len being zero when a file's buffer
 *		is empty/full. This forces the macros to call the internal routines
 *		__get_char/__put_char, which are capable of much more sophisticated
 *		handling.
 *
 *		buffer_len is also set to zero in cases where it is necessary to bypass
 *		the macros:
 *
 *		o When calling fseek, fsetpos, rewind, and fflush. All these operations
 *		  force the buffer to flush and go to a "neutral" state where either
 *		  reading or writing is permitted next. The macros are thus disabled until
 *		  after the next byte is read/written. Note that it is safe at this time
 *		  to call setbuf or setvbuf, even though the standard says you can only
 *		  do it before the first I/O operation.
 *
 *		o Whenever the file's error flag is set. Thus, the macros are disabled and
 *		  all the I/O routines will punt until explicit action is taken to clear
 *		  the error flag.
 *
 *		o At all times when writing a file in _IONBF or _IOLBF buffer mode:
 *
 *		    _IONBF needs to flush the "buffer" after every character.
 *
 *			_IOLBF needs to watch for and flush after every newline character.
