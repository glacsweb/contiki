 *		__wcstoul
 *
 *	Implementation
 *	--------------
 *
 *		The string scanner is implemented as an extended Finite State Machine.
 *		A state diagram for it can be found in an accompanying TeachText
 *		document, 'wcstoul syntax' (too bad pictures can't be imbedded in
 *		document, 'strtod syntax' (too bad pictures can't be imbedded in
 *		comments) in the "EWL Technical Notes" directory. A textual description
 *      of it follows.
 *
 *		The state transition loop dispatches to the appropriate code for the
 *		current state, while simultaneously watching for terminating
 *		conditions (field width exhausted, EOF encountered, final state
 *		reached).
 *
 *		start
 *
 *			Skip leading spaces. Process optional sign. Once a non-space is seen,
 *			trasition to next state.
 *
 *		check_for_zero
 *
 *			If 'base' is zero, then the base is either octal if there is a leading
 *			'0', hexadecimal if there is a leading '0X', or decimal if there is no
 *			leading zero at all. Also, if 'base' is 16, the leading '0X' may be
 *			optionally preset.
 *
 *			If 'base' is zero or 16, check for a leading zero. If there one,
 *			transition to the next state. Otherwise, skip to state 'need_digit' to
 *			look for at least one digit (here a 'digit' is any alphanumeric; which
 *			'digits' are actually valid depends on the determined number base).
 *
 *		leading_zero
 *
 *			Having seen a leading zero, look for a subsequent 'X' (or 'x'). If
 *			present, the base is 16: transition to state 'need_digit' to look for
 *			at least one digit. If 'base' is zero, then the base must be 8.
 *			Transition to the state 'digit_loop' to scan the rest of the number.
 *
 *		need_digit
 *		digit_loop
 *
 *			The actions of these two states are identical. However, 'digit_loop'
 *			is a final state, whereas 'need_digit' is not (i.e., if scanning
 *			terminates in 'need_digit', the scan is invalid.
 *
 *			If 'base' is still zero at this point, then the base must be 10.
 *
 *			Loop on valid digits for the established base in this state,
 *			accumulating the corresponding numerical value. Keep on the lookout
 *			for overflow.
 *
 *		finished
 *		failure
 *
 *			These states are forced upon seeing the end of the numeric string in
 *			the combined need_digit/digit_loop state to signal whether the
 *			termination was valid or not.
